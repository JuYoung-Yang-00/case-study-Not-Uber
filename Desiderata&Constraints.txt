DESIDERATA

- D1. Passengers want to be dropped off asap - minimize the amount of time (in minutes) between when they appear as an unmatched passenger, and when they are dropped off at their destination.

- D2. Drivers want to maximize ride profit, defined as the number of minutes they spend driving passengers from pickup to drop-off locations minus the number of minutes they spend driving to pickup passengers.
(For simplicity, there is no penalty for the time when a driver is idle.)

- D3. Your algorithms should be empirically efficient and scalable. You should try to optimize these deisderata subject to the following constraints C1-C3.





CONSTRAINTS

- C1. A driver can only have one passenger onboard at any given time.

- C2. Passengers can only be picked up or dropped off at their requested pickup and drop-off locations.

- C3. Once you assign a driver to a passenger, that match continues until the passenger is dropped off at their correct location - matches made by your algorithm cannot be canceled.
